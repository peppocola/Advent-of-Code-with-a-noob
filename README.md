-C++

-C

-Phython (maybe)

Day 1: (with python)
after a little bit of depression, here is my py code :) it's my first python code working ;)
it wasn't so difficult, but i found problems only in the use of files. really easy to solve.

added day1.h, with the functions day1_part1() and day2_part2(), in c++
