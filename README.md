Day 1: (with python)
after a little bit of depression, here is my py code :) it's my first python code working ;)
it wasn't so difficult, but i found some problems with using files. really easy to solve.

added day1.h, with the functions day1_part1() and day2_part2(), in c++

Day 3: (with python)
that was a little difficult, because python doesn't have some function similiar to fscanf or ifstream (c/c++), so i had to learn a bit of RegEx and i used product from iteratortools.
